## About

!!! info "`Reloaded.Memory.Buffers` is a library for allocating memory between a given minimum and maximum memory address"

With the following properties:

- ***Memory Efficient***: No wasted memory.  
- ***Shared***: Can be found and read/written to by multiple processes.  
- ***Static***: Allocated data never moves, or is overwritten.  
- ***Permanent***: Allocated data lasts the lifetime of the process.  
- ***Concurrent***: Multiple users can access at the same time.  
- **Large Address Aware:** On Windows, the library can correctly leverage all 4GB in 32-bit processes.  

## Example Use Cases

!!! tip "These are just examples."

- ***Hooks***: Hooking libraries like [Reloaded.Hooks](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.Hooks) can reduce amount of bytes stolen from functions.  
- ***Libraries***: Libraries like [Reloaded.Assembler](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.Assembler) require memory be allocated in first 2GB for x64 FASM.  

## Usage

!!! info "The library provides a simple high level API to use."

### Get A Buffer

!!! info "Gets a buffer where you can allocate 4096 bytes in first 2GiB of address space."

```csharp
var settings = new BufferSearchSettings()
{
    MinAddress = 0,
    MaxAddress = int.MaxValue,
    Size = 4096
};

// Make sure to dispose, so lock gets released.
using var item = Buffers.GetBuffer(settings);

// Write some data, get pointer back.
var ptr = item->Append(data); 
```

### Get A Buffer (With Proximity)

!!! info "Gets a buffer where 4096 bytes written will be within 2GiB of 0x140000000."

```csharp
var settings = BufferSearchSettings.FromProximity(int.MaxValue, (nuint)0x140000000, 4096);

// Make sure to dispose, so lock gets released.
using var item = Buffers.GetBuffer(settings);

// Write some data, get pointer back.
var ptr = item->Append(data); 
```

### Allocate Memory

!!! info "Allows you to temporarily allocate memory within a specific address range and size constraints."

```csharp
// Arrange
var settings = new BufferAllocatorSettings()
{
    MinAddress = 0,
    MaxAddress = int.MaxValue,
    Size = 4096
};

using var item = Buffers.AllocatePrivateMemory(settings);

// You have allocated memory in first 2GiB of address space.
// Disposing this memory (via `using` statement) will free it.
item.BaseAddress.Should().NotBeNull();
item.Size.Should().BeGreaterOrEqualTo(settings.Size);
```

!!! note "You can specify another process with `TargetProcess = someProcess` in `BufferAllocatorSettings`, but this is only supported on Windows."
