## About

!!! info "`Reloaded.Memory.Buffers` is a library for allocating memory between a given minimum and maximum memory address, for C# and Rust"

With the following properties:

- ***Memory Efficient***: No wasted memory.  
- ***Shared***: Can be found and read/written to by multiple users.  
- ***Static***: Allocated data never moves, or is overwritten.  
- ***Permanent***: Allocated data lasts the lifetime of the process.  
- ***Concurrent***: Multiple users can access at the same time.  
- ***Large Address Aware:*** On Windows, the library can correctly leverage all 4GB in 32-bit processes.  
- ***Cross Platform***: Supports Windows, OSX and Linux.  

Note: Rust/C port also works with FreeBSD (untested), and has partial [(limited) Android support](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.Memory.Buffers/issues/3).

## Example Use Cases

!!! tip "These are just examples."

- ***Hooks***: Hooking libraries like [Reloaded.Hooks](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.Hooks) can reduce amount of bytes stolen from functions.  
- ***Libraries***: Libraries like [Reloaded.Assembler](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.Assembler) require memory be allocated in first 2GB for x64 FASM.  

## Usage

!!! info "The library provides a simple high level API to use."

!!! note "Both C# and Rust ports expose the same APIs."

### Get A Buffer

!!! info "Gets a buffer where you can allocate 4096 bytes in first 2GiB of address space."

=== "C#"

	```csharp
	var settings = new BufferSearchSettings()
	{
		MinAddress = 0,
		MaxAddress = int.MaxValue,
		Size = 4096
	};

	// Make sure to dispose, so lock gets released.
	using var item = Buffers.GetBuffer(settings);

	// Write some data, get pointer back.
	var ptr = item->Append(data); 
	```

=== "Rust"

	```rust
	let settings = BufferSearchSettings {
		min_address: 0 as usize,
		max_address: i32::MAX as usize,
		size: 4096,
	};

	// Automatically dropped.
	let item = Buffers::get_buffer(&settings)?;

	// Append some data.
	unsafe {
		item.append_bytes(data);
	}
	```

=== "C/C++"

	```cpp
	BufferSearchSettings settings;
	settings.MinAddress = 0;
	settings.MaxAddress = INT_MAX;
	settings.Size = 4096;

	// Automatically dropped.
	GetBufferResult result = buffers_get_buffer(&settings);

	// Append some data.
	unsigned char data[4096] = {0}; // some data from heap, or something :wink:
	if (result.IsOk) {
		locatoritem_append_bytes(result.Ok, data, sizeof(data));
		free_get_buffer_result(result);
	}
	```

### Get A Buffer (With Proximity)

!!! info "Gets a buffer where 4096 bytes written will be within 2GiB of 0x140000000."

=== "C#"

	```csharp
	var settings = BufferSearchSettings.FromProximity(int.MaxValue, (nuint)0x140000000, 4096);

	// Make sure to dispose, so lock gets released.
	using var item = Buffers.GetBuffer(settings);

	// Write some data, get pointer back.
	var ptr = item->Append(data); 
	```

=== "Rust"

	```rust
	let settings = BufferSearchSettings::from_proximity(i32::MAX, 0x140000000 as usize, 4096);
	
	// Automatically dropped.
	let item = Buffers::get_buffer(settings)?;

	// Append some data.
	unsafe {
		item?.append_bytes(data);
	}
	```

=== "C/C++"

	```c
	// Get the buffer
	BufferSearchSettings settings = buffersearchsettings_from_proximity(INT32_MAX, base_address, SIZE);
	GetBufferResult result = buffers_get_buffer(&settings);

	// Append some data.
	locatoritem_append_bytes(result.Ok, &data[0], data.Length);

	// Dispose
	free_get_buffer_result(result);
	```

### Allocate Memory

!!! info "Allows you to temporarily allocate memory within a specific address range and size constraints."


=== "C#"

	```csharp
	// Arrange
	var settings = new BufferAllocatorSettings()
	{
		MinAddress = 0,
		MaxAddress = int.MaxValue,
		Size = 4096
	};

	using var item = Buffers.AllocatePrivateMemory(settings);

	// You have allocated memory in first 2GiB of address space.
	// Disposing this memory (via `using` statement) will free it.
	item.BaseAddress.Should().NotBeNull();
	item.Size.Should().BeGreaterOrEqualTo(settings.Size);
	```

=== "Rust"

	```rust
	let mut settings = BufferAllocatorSettings::new();
	settings.min_address = 0;
	settings.max_address = i32::MAX as usize;
	settings.size = 4096;

	let item = Buffers::allocate_private_memory(&mut settings).unwrap();

	// You have allocated memory in first 2GiB of address space.
	assert!(item.base_address.as_ptr() != std::ptr::null_mut());
	assert!(item.size >= settings.size as usize);
	```

=== "C/C++"

	```cpp
	BufferSearchSettings settings;
	settings.MinAddress = 0;
	settings.MaxAddress = INT_MAX;
	settings.Size = 4096;

	AllocationResult item = allocate_private_memory(&mut settings);

	// You have allocated memory in first 2GiB of address space.
	```

!!! note "You can specify another process with `TargetProcess = someProcess` in `BufferAllocatorSettings`, but this is only supported on Windows."
