## About

`Reloaded.Memory.Buffers` is a library for allocating memory between a given minimum and maximum memory address, for C# and Rust.

With the following properties:

- ***Memory Efficient***: No wasted memory.  
- ***Shared***: Can be found and read/written to by multiple users.  
- ***Static***: Allocated data never moves, or is overwritten.  
- ***Permanent***: Allocated data lasts the lifetime of the process.  
- ***Concurrent***: Multiple users can access at the same time.  
- ***Large Address Aware:*** On Windows, the library can correctly leverage all 4GB in 32-bit processes.  
- ***Cross Platform***: Supports Windows, OSX and Linux.  

Note: Rust/C port also work with FreeBSD (untested), and has partial [(limited) Android support](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.Memory.Buffers/issues/3).

## Wiki & Documentation

[For full documentation, please see the Wiki](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded.Memory.Buffers/).  

## Example Use Cases

These are just examples:  

- ***Hooks***: Hooking libraries like [Reloaded.Hooks](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.Hooks) can reduce amount of bytes stolen from functions.
- ***Libraries***: Libraries like [Reloaded.Assembler](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.Assembler) require memory be allocated in first 2GB for x64 FASM.

## Usage

!!! info "The library provides a simple high level API to use."

!!! info "See [Wiki](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded.Memory.Buffers/) for Rust usage"

### Get A Buffer

Gets a buffer where you can allocate 4096 bytes in first 2GiB of address space.

```csharp
var settings = new BufferSearchSettings()
{
    MinAddress = 0,
    MaxAddress = int.MaxValue,
    Size = 4096
};

// Make sure to dispose, so lock gets released.
using var item = Buffers.GetBuffer(settings);

// Write some data, get pointer back.
var ptr = item->Append(data); 
```

### Get A Buffer (With Proximity)

Gets a buffer where 4096 bytes written will be within 2GiB of 0x140000000.

```csharp
var settings = BufferSearchSettings.FromProximity(int.MaxValue, (nuint)0x140000000, 4096);

// Make sure to dispose, so lock gets released.
using var item = Buffers.GetBuffer(settings);

// Write some data, get pointer back.
var ptr = item->Append(data); 
```

### Allocate Memory

Allows you to temporarily allocate memory within a specific address range and size constraints.

```csharp
// Arrange
var settings = new BufferAllocatorSettings()
{
    MinAddress = 0,
    MaxAddress = int.MaxValue,
    Size = 4096
};

using var item = Buffers.AllocatePrivateMemory(settings);

// You have allocated memory in first 2GiB of address space.
// Disposing this memory (via `using` statement) will free it.
item.BaseAddress.Should().NotBeNull();
item.Size.Should().BeGreaterOrEqualTo(settings.Size);
```

You can specify another process with `TargetProcess = someProcess` in `BufferAllocatorSettings`, but this is only supported on Windows.

## Crate Features (Rust)

- *no_format*: Disables formatting code in errors, saving ~8kB of space.  
- *size_opt*: Makes cold paths optimized for size instead of optimized for speed. [Requires 'nightly' Rust]
